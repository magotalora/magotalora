- 👋 Hi, I’m Miguel Ángel García Otalora, although my friends call me Migue, I have a background in communications and always was
- 👀 interested in technology and how can we use it to make the world a better place. Which inspired me to go for a career shift and
- 🗺️ move to Denmark in 2021. I live in a little town named Esbjerg, where most of the wind turbines in Europe are made. I’m currently
- 🌱 studying a BSc in Applied Industrial Electronics in Aalborg University, and this semester we are
- 🦾 working on a Home Securiy System (combining a Raspberry Pi 4, a fingerprint reader, an electronic lock and a camera).
- ✨ I would like to collaborate in projects involving hardware, especially in projects involving audio.
